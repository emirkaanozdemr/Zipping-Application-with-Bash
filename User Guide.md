<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don't use space to create file and directory(folder) names. For example this is wrong: "My First Bash Script" but this is true: "My_First_Bash_Script"</li>
  <li>When giving different folders as input to the application, do not forget to leave a space between the names of different folders.</li>
<li>Be sure your computer has Bash. Linux and MacOS already have Bash installed. But if your computer's OS is Windows you have to install Bash in your computer.</li>
<li>Be sure script.sh and directories(folders) -the will be zipped- in the same folder. You can change directory usind "cd" and you can be sure with "pwd" to you are in the right directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hto">How to operate</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should activate Bash in your Terminal(or Bash shell). I use MacOS and in MacOS you can made it writing "bash" in your terminal.
</li>
<li>You have to write "chmod +x script.sh" to file be executable.</li>
<li>To execute the script: "./script.sh"</li>
<li>Now you can use application</li>
